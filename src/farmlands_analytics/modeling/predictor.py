class FarmlandsPredictiveModels:
    """
    Comprehensive machine learning modeling suite for agricultural supply chain optimization.
    
    This class provides a complete set of predictive models specifically designed
    for agricultural supply chain management and optimization. It focuses on
    delivering actionable predictions that support Farmlands Co-operative's
    operational and strategic decision-making processes.
    
    The modeling suite addresses key agricultural business challenges:
    - Demand forecasting with seasonal agricultural patterns
    - Price prediction incorporating market and weather factors
    - Inventory optimization for seasonal agricultural products
    - Customer segmentation for targeted agricultural marketing
    - Weather impact assessment for supply planning
    - Supply chain risk evaluation and mitigation strategies
    
    Model categories:
    - Time Series Models: ARIMA, Prophet, LSTM for demand forecasting
    - Regression Models: Linear, Random Forest, XGBoost for price prediction
    - Optimization Models: Linear programming for inventory management
    - Clustering Models: K-means, hierarchical for customer segmentation
    - Classification Models: Risk assessment and weather impact prediction
    
    Attributes:
        data_path (Path): Path to input data directory
        model_output_path (Path): Directory for saving trained models and artifacts
        models (Dict): Trained model storage
        scalers (Dict): Feature scaling objects
        encoders (Dict): Categorical encoding objects
        feature_importance (Dict): Model feature importance scores
        
    Example:
        >>> ml_suite = FarmlandsPredictiveModels(\"data/raw/\", \"models/\")
        >>> datasets = ml_suite.load_and_prepare_data()
        >>> forecast_results = ml_suite.demand_forecasting_model()
        >>> print(f\"Forecast accuracy: {forecast_results['performance']['mape']:.2f}%\")
