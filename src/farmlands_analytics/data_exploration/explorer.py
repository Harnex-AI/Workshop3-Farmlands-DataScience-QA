    Comprehensive exploratory data analysis toolkit for agricultural supply chain data.
    
    This class provides a complete suite of analytical tools specifically designed
    for exploring and understanding agricultural supply chain data. It focuses on
    generating actionable insights for Farmlands Co-operative's operations through
    sophisticated data analysis and visualization techniques.
    
    The explorer handles multiple data types including:
    - Sales transaction data with temporal patterns
    - Weather data with regional variations
    - Farm characteristics and metadata
    - Product performance and inventory data
    
    Key analytical capabilities:
    - Statistical summaries with agricultural context
    - Seasonal pattern analysis for New Zealand farming cycles
    - Regional performance comparisons across NZ agricultural regions
    - Product performance tracking and optimization insights
    - Weather correlation analysis for supply planning
    - Interactive dashboards for real-time decision making
